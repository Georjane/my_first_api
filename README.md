# Practice using API in Rails and JS

## JS
The api js folder contains an html file that fetches a gif from the giphy website about cats and dislays it. It also fetches weather info about any city of your choice and displays the city name and country code. This is just for practice purposes. You won't find any useful info.

## Rails
When you run your rails server, you will have access to a form to input a Flickr ID of anybody and upon submiting the form, you will see the user's photos on Flickr.
